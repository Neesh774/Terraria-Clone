## How To Play

- Find a tree and mine it
- Craft a wooden pickaxe
- Make a house (optional)
- Mine down to stone level, and mine some stone
- Craft a stone pickaxe and a stone sword
- Mine down more to find iron ore, and mine it
- Craft the iron ore into raw iron
- Craft the raw iron and some planks into an iron pickaxe and an iron sword
- Strip mine to find a Bird Spawn block
- Break the Bird Spawn and go back to the surface (Platforms are useful!)
- Craft the Bird Spawn into a Bird Egg and click anywhere to spawn it
- Make sure you have the sword out, and run away from the bird when it's falling down!
